A WordPress 3.8 Admin Theme for the **Wolf CMS 0.8.1**!

* Original WordPress Form and Button Set
* Many Design Subtleties
* Tested with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox

## First Alpha Version
The WordPress Admin Theme for Wolf CMS (0.8.1) is still alpha, therefore may contain this template 
quite a few design bugs.

To resolve each error and to make this template awesome we beseech Thee to report me each Bug. Use 
therefore the Issue-Page on GitHub or write me a mail to <pytes@gmx.net>.

Thank You!
