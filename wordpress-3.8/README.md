WordPress 3.8 AdminTheme
===========================
>	Version: 0.2.0 Alpha<br />
>	Author: SamBrishes <pytes@gmx.net>

The WordPress 3.8 AdminTheme gives the admin area of the Content Management System 
*[Wolf CMS](https://github.com/wolfcms/wolfcms)* (version 0.8.1 / 0.8.2) a "WordPress Backend" 
-similar design.

**Attention:** The next theme update will be published for the incoming *Wolf CMS* version, because 
the Backend UI will changed immensely (or better will be re-created), according to the developers on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/SamBrishes/wolfcms-wordpress-admintheme/issues/1). So the 0.2.0 update 
for the WordPress 3.8 AdminTheme is presumably the last version for the *Wolf CMS* 0.8.1 / 0.8.2!

#### Seond Alpha Version
This AdminTheme for the *Wolf CMS* is still an alpha build and this means, that this version may 
still contains some bugs and code oddities. So if you find any error or design strangeness, please 
report it together with the used browser + the used OS on the GitHub Issues Page or via mail to 
<pytes@gmx.net>.

**Thank You!**
